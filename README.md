# Early type 2 Diabetes Prediction tool

This is the final project for the course [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/home/)
offered by Johns Hopkins University, available on Coursera.

## Project Overview
The project consists of:
- **A Shiny Web App** tool for the prediction of early type 2 diabetes based on clinical data.
- The **ui.R** and **server.R** code files for the Shiny App
- A 5 slides **Presentation** to pitch the App

## Introduction
This is a simple Prediction App that display the probability of being classified as *Positive* or *Negative* for the presence of type 2 Diabetes based on the input of 
clinical data:
1. Age

12. Delayed healing of wounds
13. Partial paresis of a limb
14. Presence of muscle stiffnes
15. Presence of alopecia
16. Obesity
